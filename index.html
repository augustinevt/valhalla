      How do I write the story of our band and leave out how we got married,
how God has led us down all these paths, and how our family has grown and developed?  Because these are the story of our band.

In the Spring of ’97, on the exact same day,
before either of us ever talked about it
or showed any interest in the other,
God revealed to Barry and I that we were going to marry.
We were married in July of ’97.
Our marriage has been a continual process
of growth, refinement, challenge, heartache and joy.
Throughout we have sought God on major life decisions
as well as the minor day to day choices.
He has taught us how to function as a family in unity.
How did He teach us?  Little by little, line upon line,
precept upon precept, as we walk by the way.
That’s how we have taught our children.  The result?
A family that delights in each other’s company.
A family in unity, in harmony.
That’s the story of our band.
That is the foundation without which
our band and our family would crumble.</p>

It helps that I was a music major at FSU,
and have taught the children instruments.
But at the heart of our band is a love for God,
a love for each other,
and yes, a love for music.</p><br>

Everyone played classical music until 2013
when Hosanna learned a fiddle tune.
Ethan began accompanying her on the piano,
and then was given an accordion by his Grandfather.</p><br>

Early in 2014 our band consisted of
Hosanna on fiddle, Ethan on accordion, and Micah on spoons.
With a repertoire of a dozen fiddle tunes, they collected a few tips
at the local farmer’s market, usually not much,
but once an older guy put in $30 and said,
“You don’t hear young people play this kind of music.”</p><br>

<p>That summer Micah bought a mandolin from vegetables he sold from his garden.  Moriah started learning the guitar and I got an upright bass.
We began playing at nursing homes, for friends, churches, and anyone that would listen.  In 2015 Lydia started the banjo,
and Hosanna got a dobro.
We also started singing.</p><br>

<p>We are thrilled with the doors the Lord has opened for us
and look forward to what the future holds.
But the absolute most precious thing is the joy of gathering round,
picking and singing, and basking in the harmonies
that God has brought to our hearts.
